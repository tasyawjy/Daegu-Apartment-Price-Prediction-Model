# Daegu-Apartment-Price-Prediction-Model

**Context**

Daegu, officially known as the Metropolitan City of Daegu, is the third largest metropolitan in South Korea after Seoul and Busan with a population of around 2.5 million people. Daegu is surrounded by the Palgong-san Mountains to the north, the Biseul-san Mountains to the south, the Gaya-san hillfoots to the west, and a range of small hills to the east. Despite its beautiful scenery and seemingly cool atmosphere, Daegu remains like any other metropolitan city. With a dense population and limited land, Daegu, like other metropolitan cities, relies on apartments as a housing option for its residents. In South Korea, especially in larger cities, most people prefer to buy or sell apartments through real estate agents. This has led to a large number of real estate agents offering their services to help buy or sell apartments. 

When it comes to apartment unit sales, offers are typically made by individuals or companies. The price of an apartment unit is determined by bidders through a platform. This process can make it challenging for apartment owners to adjust their prices to match the market value. If the unit's price is too high in comparison to market prices, making a sale becomes difficult. On the other hand, if the price is too low, the owner may not be able to maximize their profit.

In the context of apartment sales, the prices are determined by bidders on a platform. This method makes it difficult for apartment owners to conform to market prices. Therefore, real estate agents help property owners determine the estimated selling price of an apartment based on property information such as the condition of the building and location, considering the market price of apartment housing in the city of Daegu as a reference. If the price is too high compared to other similar properties in the area, few people will buy the property. On the other hand, if it is too low, the property owner will not receive a proportional profit. This information must be understood by the property owner as it relates to the profit that can be obtained and by the property buyer so as not to incur a loss by getting the appropriate price.

**Problem Statement**

Therefore, real estate agents face a significant challenge in having a business model that provides financial benefits for property owners while also offering fair prices to potential buyers. `A proper model is needed to solve the problem of determining the selling price of apartments, to generate profits for property owners and real estate agents.` Moreover, to ensure that apartment prices in the area are perceived as fair and do not have a large difference between one apartment and another.

**Goals**

The goal based on the existing issues is that real estate agents need to have a tool that can be used to predict and assist property owners in determining the right selling price of the apartment. The differences in various features of a property, such as the year of construction, location, and type of hallway, can increase the accuracy of the selling price prediction, which can bring profit to the property owner.

**Analytic Approach**

So, what needs to be done is to analyze the data to find patterns from the existing features that differentiate one apartment from another. Then, it is necessary to build a regression model that will help the real estate agent to provide a prediction tool for the sales price of new apartments on their list, which will be useful for the property owner in determining the sales price of their apartment.
